#+TITLE: Install sensetion.el

You can install it yourself, or use the docker image. If installing
manually, note that you might need Emacs version 26 or higher.

* Dependencies
- [[https://curl.haxx.se/download.html][curl]] -- you probably already have it installed
- [[https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch][elastic search]]

* Data
- TODO

* Emacs beginner installation
- Download and install emacs -- instructions [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][here]].
- Clone this repository ([[https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository][how-to]]) to your home directory ; If you don't
  know what your home directory is, you can run
  : emacs --batch --eval '(print (expand-file-name "~/"))' --kill
  in your terminal; the resulting path is your home directory.
- Copy the file =.emacs.d/init.el= in this repository to an =.emacs.d=
  directory in your home directory (if it doesn't exist yet, create
  it).
- Open emacs and call =M-x sensetion=.


* Manual installation
- Clone this repository -- preferentially to your home directory.
- The file at =.emacs.d/init.el= in this repository has comments
  specifying code you should include in your init file to have
  sensetion.el running smoothly. In summary you must install
  dependencies from [[http://melpa.org/][MELPA]] and [[http://elpa.gnu.org/][ELPA]], and tell emacs where this library
  and the annotation files are in your file system (unless you placed
  them in the default locations in your home directory). If you are
  using a Mac, you might also need the package =exec-path-from-shell=,
  available from MELPA.
- Restart emacs (or reload or your init file).


* Docker installation
- install docker for your platform.
- clone this repository.
- run
  : docker build -t sensetion .
  in the root directory of the repository.
- run
  : docker run -it -v /path/to/annotation/files:/home/sensetioner/sensetion-data sensetion emacs
  to start annotating. Remember to change the path to the annotation
  files to the appropriate directory.
