You can install it yourself, or use the docker image.

* dependencies

** emacs
Download and install emacs -- instructions [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][here]].

# ** wn
# You may download the =wn= executable from your favorite package
# manager (for Mac users that's brew: install from [[brew.sh][here]] and run =brew
# install wordnet=). Be aware that package managers usually offer
# WordNet 3.1, and not WordNet 3.0, which is the WordNet we use to
# annotate the WN gloss corpus. If that is the case, download [[http://wordnetcode.princeton.edu/3.0/WNdb-3.0.tar.gz][WordNet
# 3.0 database files]], and either:

# - set the =WNSEARCHDIR= variable to the directory of the WordNet 3.0
#   database files. Add the following line to =.profile= in your home
#   directory:
#   : export WNSEARCHDIR="$HOME/builds/WordNet-3.0/dict"
#   substituting the path for the corresponding directory where you
#   downloaded it.

** elisp
- Clone this repository ([[https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository][how-to]]) -- preferentially to your home
  directory ;
- If you are new to emacs, you can simply copy the =.emacs.d/init.el=
  file in the root of this repository to a directory named =.emacs.d=
  in your home directory and things will be taken care of for you. If
  you do know emacs, take a look at the file and see how it is done;
- By default the =init.el= file assumes you clone this repository to
  your home directory; If you cloned it to
  ="~/projects/sensetion.el/"= you must search =init.el= for
  =~/sensetion.el= and replace it.
- Download the annotation files (if you haven't got them already) and
  edit =init.el= to have the path to their directory. The default
  directory for the annotation files is ="~/sensetion-data/"=;
- Restart emacs (or reload or your init file).


* docker
- install docker for your platform ;
- clone this repository ;
- run
  : docker build -t sensetion .
  in the root directory of the repository;
- run
  : docker run -it -v /path/to/annotation/files:/home/sensetioner/sensetion-data sensetion emacs
  to start annotating. Remember to change the path to the annotation
  files to the appropriate directory.
