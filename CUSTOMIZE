#+TITLE: Customizing sensetion.el

Among others, =sensetion.el= allows the following customizations:

- changing default buffer names ;
- toggling display of word sense information such as synset ids ;
- changing token status colours ;
- restricting (or not) user-supplied lemmas to those found in wordnet ;
- displaying (or not) sentence ids

A complete and up-to-date list of these can be found by running =M-x
customize-group RET sensetion=.

These customizations can be performed:

- using the emacs graphical customization system: just run =M-x
  customize-group RET sensetion= and all options should be there, with
  accompanying documentation; do not forget to save your changes
  (*recommended way, specially for beginners*)

- using =use-package= or similar libraries (*recommended for advanced
  use*)

- manually, by setting the variables to the desired variables using
  =setq= or =setf= (*not recommended*)
