#+TITLE: Word-sense annotation in Emacs

=sensetion.el= is a sense-annotation interface which is being used to
finish the word-sense annotations of the [[http://wordnetcode.princeton.edu/glosstag.shtml][WordNet gloss corpus]], but
that can used to sense-tag any corpus in the JSON format we have
specified.

* Installation
See the =INSTALL= file.


* Usage
Use =M-x sensetion= to start annotating. This will ask you for a lemma
and a PoS tag. You can press =TAB= for completion of the lemma. This
will build a buffer with instances of this lemma+pos that have not
been annotated yet. Unannotated words will show as red/pink, while
previously-annotated tokens will show as green, and newly-annotated
tokens will show as blue (all these colors can be customized by the
user). For annotated tokens, dark colours indicate confidence in the
annotation. You can navigate through annotatable tokens with =<= and
=>=.

If you wish to sense-tag a token, press =/= on it. You may select one
or many senses -- or no sense at all -- by pressing the appropriate
keyboard key. Senses which are already selected are prefixed by a plus
sign (=+=); when satisfied, press enter/return. If you'd like to quit,
press =q=; note that quitting does not undo anything (if you selected
an option and then quit, its effects were already carried out). You
can see how many tokens still need to be annotated in the mode-line,
next to the =sensetion= indicator.

Any editing action is saved in the buffer, but these are only
propagated to the backend when you close the buffer and select confirm
you would like to keep these changes.

If you wish to change a token's lemma use =l=. If you wish to say a
token is not annotatable (i.e., ignore it), use =i=. If you wish to
say you are unsure about an annotation, use =?=.

There is support for word collocations, such as phrasal verbs. The
tokens part of a collocation are united by a key, which is shown in
their bottom left corner. You can unglob a collocation by pressing =u=
in any token of the collocation. To glob tokens, you mark them with
=m= and finally press =g= to create the collocation. If you marked a
token by mistake, you can unmark tokens by pressing =m= again. If you
try to edit the lemma of a token part of collocation, you will be
asked if you would like to edit the token itself or its collocation.

You can move sentences up or down with =C-↑= and =C-↓=. Clustering
tokens with the same sense together might be useful.

Note that you can customize most things (like annotation colors) with
=M-x customize-group RET sensetion=.

** Command summary
You can call a command using =M-x <command-name>= or by pressing its
keybinding. If you find that there are too many editing and navigation
commands to memorize, you just need to memorize the command =s=, which
invokes a menu which includes all other commands.

* Report bugs
- Give clear instructions to reproduce the bug;
- Call =M-x toggle-debug-on-error=, reproduce the bug, and send the
  backtrace with your report (you may open an [[https://github.com/own-pt/sensetion.el/issues][issue]]).


* FAQ -- Frequently Asked Questions
** How can I copy and paste annotation text without super/subscripts?
You can assign the function =org-copy-visible= to your copying command
key in the annotation buffers by adding these two lines to your
sensetion =use-package= declaration:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package sensetion
   :commands sensetion
+  :bind (:map sensetion-mode-map
+              ("M-w" . org-copy-visible))
#+END_SRC


# * Annotation format

# We convert the original Glosstag XML files to property lists and then
# to JSON, whose grammar can be found in =glosstag/grammar.txt=.

# The script that converts the original XML WN gloss corpus is at
# =convert.sh=. To re-run the conversion:

# - download the [[http://wordnetcode.princeton.edu/glosstag.shtml][WordNet gloss corpus]];
#   - you can validate it with the =xmllint= utility from the =libxml=
#     package:
#     : xmllint --dtdvalid dtd/glosstag.dtd merged/*.xml
# - download and setup [[http://www.sbcl.org/][sbcl]] (although any common lisp implementation
#   should work);
# - setup [[https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/][quicklisp]];
# - create a symbolic link from the =glosstag= directory inside the
#   =quicklisp/local-projects/=.
# - run:
#   : ./convert.sh ~/WordNet-3.0/glosstag/merged/ DESTINATION-PATH/
#   where the first parameter is a directory is from the gloss corpus
#   archive, the last parameter is the directory is where you want to
#   put the files. (Use absolute paths if you have problems with the
#   command.) Note that the trailing slash in =glosstag/= is
#   important. You must have the glosstag DTD in the same directory as
#   the annotation files.


* Status

Under development -- user interface is still unstable.
