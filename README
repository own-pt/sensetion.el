#+TITLE: Word-sense annotation in Emacs

This project intends to finish the word-sense annotations of the
[[http://wordnetcode.princeton.edu/glosstag.shtml][WordNet gloss corpus]], but can be used to sense-tag any corpus in the
S-expression-based format we have defined.


* Usage
You should set the directory where the files to be annotated are with
=M-x customize-variable RET sensetion-annotation-dir=. (You can
customize other stuff with =M-x customize-group RET sensetion=.)

Use =M-x sensetion= to start annotating. If this is the first time you
call it, it might take some time to index the files (you can do other
stuff on Emacs while it works).

=M-x sensetion-annotate= will ask you for a lemma and a PoS tag. You
can press =TAB= for completion of the lemma. This will build a buffer
with instances of this lemma+pos that have not been annotated yet. You
can navigate through taggable tokens with =<= and =>=. If you wish to
annotate a token, press =/= on it. You can see how many tokens still
need to be annotated in the mode-line, next to the =sensetion=
indicator.

There is support for word collocations, such as phrasal verbs. The
tokens part of a collocation are united by a key, which is shown in
their bottom left corner.  You can unglob a collocation by pressing
=u= in any token of the collocation.  To glob tokens, you mark them
with =m= and finally press =g= to create the collocation. If you
marked a token by mistake, you can unmark tokens by pressing =m=
again.

You can move sentences up or down with =C-↑= and =C-↓=. Clustering
tokens with the same sense together might be useful.

If the index goes out of sync, you can force a new indexation with
=M-x sensetion-make-state=.


* Report bugs
- Give clear instructions to reproduce the bug;
- Call =M-x toggle-debug-on-error=, reproduce the bug, and send the
  backtrace with your report.


* Installation
You need both elisp libraries and the =wn= executable.

** elisp
- make sure you have ELPA and [[https://melpa.org/#/getting-started][MELPA]] set up, so that you can download
  dependencies easily.
- to make things easier, install =use-package= with =M-x
  install-package RET use-package=.
- clone this repository.
- add the following snippet to your user configuration file (usually
  at =~/emacs.d/init.el=), substituting the paths to the appropriate
  ones:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (use-package hydra :defer t :ensure t)
    (use-package flycheck :defer t :ensure t)
    (use-package s :defer t :ensure t)
    (use-package f :defer t :ensure t)
    (use-package trie :defer t :ensure t)
    (use-package async :defer t :ensure t)

    (use-package sensetion
      :commands sensetion
      :load-path "~/sensetion.el/"
      :bind (:map sensetion-mode-map
                  ;; here you can customize the standard command names; we
                  ;; don't like to use '/' to invoke sensetion-edit, so we
                  ;; bind it to 'e'
                  ("e" . sensetion-edit))
      :custom (sensetion-annotation-dir "~/path/to/annotation/files"))
  #+END_SRC
  this will ensure the dependencies are installed and that the
  packages are properly loaded at the right time.
- restart emacs (or reload or your init file).


** wn
You may download the =wn= executable from your favorite package
manager. Be aware that package managers usually offer WordNet 3.1, and
not WordNet 3.0, which is the WordNet we use to annotate the WN gloss
corpus. If that is the case, download [[http://wordnetcode.princeton.edu/3.0/WNdb-3.0.tar.gz][WordNet 3.0 database files]], and
move them to the corresponding directory of package you installed.


* Annotation format
We convert the original XML files to property lists.

** conversion from original XML
The script that converts the original XML WN gloss corpus is at
=convert.lisp=. The MISC field of the annotation files saves lots of
information from the XML to preserve a mapping between them.

To re-run the conversion:

- download the [[http://wordnetcode.princeton.edu/glosstag.shtml][WordNet gloss corpus]];
- download the [[http://wordnetcode.princeton.edu/3.0/WNdb-3.0.tar.gz][WordNet 3.0 database files]];
- download and setup [[http://www.sbcl.org/][sbcl]] (although any common lisp implementation
  should work);
- setup [[https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/][quicklisp]];
- run:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    sbcl --dynamic-space-size 7500Mb --load convert.lisp --load convert.lisp --eval '(time (xml->conllus (directory "merged/*.xml") "conllu/" "index.sense"))' --quit
  #+END_SRC
  where the =merged/= directory is from the gloss corpus archive, the
  =conllu= directory is where you want to put the files, and the
  =index.sense= file is from the WordNet database. (Use absolute paths
  if you have problems with the command.)


* Status
Under heavy development -- user interface is unstable, and the code is
still to be generalized so that it can be made useful for annotation
of other corpora (maybe even of other stuff).
